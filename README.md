## Description

This application guides the user through sets of billiards drills that are designed to improve the user's game. The user can select from a variety of drills and the application will guide the user through the drill, providing instructions and feedback. The user can also track their progress and see how they are improving over time. The application is designed to be used on a mobile device so that the user can take it with them to the pool hall and use it while they are practicing. The application is designed to be easy to use and intuitive so that the user can focus on their game and not on the application. It is in the early stages, this is just a front end, but will eventually be integrated into a full stack mobile application where a user can create their own drills and build their own routines and compare results with friends.
